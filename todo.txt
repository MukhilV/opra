-vote function (in views.py): make response object, add preferences to dictionary, etc.
-admin.py:
	-add viewable responses section, can filter by student or question
	-add algorithms section, with following options:
		-choose algorithm to use (from drop-down)
		-run algorithm
		-publish results (automatic after algorithm runs?)
-DetailView (in views.py) & detail.html: add student name selection drop-down
-ResultsView (in views.py) & results.html: change to show results of allocation when admin publishes them
-optional: add forms.py to simplify html stuff
	-idk if itâ€™s worth the effort to do this?
-bonus:
	-automate emailing
	-add student user authentication
	-figure out grad/undergrad distinction with date selection???

Also: I think a Project model might be useful, to group Questions that go together, so that the algorithm knows which Questions to use for the allocation stuff.
