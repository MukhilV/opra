-admin.py:
	-add section to view preferences from dict (currently can just view student/question/timestamp/allocation of a response)
	-allow admin to choose which questions/results are published on the index page (possibly select date range?)
	-allow admin to select allocation algorithm to use (i suppose we could define a different admin action for each algorithm but that repeats a lot of code, idk)
	-don't let admin run algorithm on responses with different questions (currently causes error)
	-don't let admin run algorithm on follow-up question before primary question has been allocated (currently causes error)
-bonus:
	-automate emailing
	-add student user authentication
	-figure out grad/undergrad distinction with date selection???
	-make the UI not look like shit
	-do more testing to make sure it doesnâ€™t break
