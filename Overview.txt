## 1. Structure of OPRA:

compsocsite/
	1. manage.py 
	// Use this file to run this project

	2. appauth 
	// This folder is for registering users and login/logout. Also includes global settings. 

	3. compsocsite
	// This is the global folder for OPRA.

	4. polls
	// For single polls. This is the core of the project.

	5. multipolls
	// For multi-polls. Polling can be done in multiple rounds. Code is built off of polls.

	6. groups
	// For groups. Groups are used to making adding and removing a large number of voters convenient 

	7. static
	// For image, js, css files

## 2. Structure of each folder

Generally, each main app folder (polls, multipolls, groups) will follow a similar structure. 

migrations (folder): Used to store database changes as the model is updated. The files are updated automatically using the commands:
 
<code> python3 manage.py makemigrations </code> 

<code> python3 manage.py migrate </code>

templates (folder): This contains all the view files, which are a mix of HTML and Django template language. You can customize the display of each file in your browser. 

models.py: Contains all the model (class) definitions.

urls.py: Contains a list of links displayed in the browser, where each link has its own function. The function can either render the view or perform calculations. 

views.py: Contains all the logic required to retrieve data from the database and perform calculations.

Keep in mind:
Every time you add a new model, you update models.py and then migrate the database. 

Every time you want to add a new template page, you add a new file to the templates folder and then update urls.py and views.py so that Django will know how to render the page.
