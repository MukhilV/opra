final project for Computational Social Choice


The goal of this project is to create a web app that assists in the assignment of presentations to students. It will allow students to rank their preferences for a project topic and presentation date. When all students have input their preferences, it will algorithmically decide a fair allocation of topics and presentation dates for all students.
